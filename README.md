## RL Assessed Coursework 1

This repo is for you to submit your coursework 1 code for automated marking on LabTS. Here you can find a template notebook `coursework1.ipynb`, in which you should write your code, and a placeholder file `coursework1.py`.
You should follow the instructions in the coursework specifications to complete the parts of the notebook labelled with `[Action required]`.
Once you wish to test your solutions, export the notebook into a Python file (make sure to _export_ the notebook properly, and not to just _rename_ it to be a .py file, otherwise your code will not run), and ensure the new file is named `coursework1.py`. This is the file you will submit for testing, and you can do so by pushing it to this repo (thus overwriting the provided placeholder file) and running your submission on LabTS.

The classes and methods you implement should not rely on any library other than the standard Python libraries and NumPy, as other external libraries may not be installed on the systems we test your code on.
We also suggest you remove the code that executes experiments and generates plots from the `coursework1.py` file you submit, as these are not required for code testing and will only slow down or interfere with the process of running the automated marking on your script.
There is a time limit of 5 minutes for the whole testing process.
This involves carrying out training runs of the agents you code, and this is significantly longer than the amount of time required to train successful agents in this coursework.
